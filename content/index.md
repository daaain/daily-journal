Hey there,

Welcome to the Daily Journal app!

This is an experiment to help me keep up with my daily work journaling, but it’s of course open for anyone to use. Just press "Journal" in the top bar to start!

As you start writing, your journal will be saved locally in your browser, so you can close the window and come back any time with everything saved.

In case you want to back up your data (and settings), you can export everything into a file and import back later. I’m also planning to integrate with Dropbox to make this smoother and enable synchronisation between devices.

This project is open source, hosted on Github:

This live site is deployed using Netlify.
